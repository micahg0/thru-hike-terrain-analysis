# Thru-hike terrain analysis: Is the PCT, CDT, or AT better?

This analysis compares the terrain along three major long-distance thru-hike trails in the United
States to identify areas of geological complexity. The terrain is characterized based on Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) data derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) dataset.
This analysis attempts to derive an appropriate frequency signature for sections of the trail using
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on elevation profiles filtered by the Continuous Wavelet
Transform (CWT). These signatures are then analyzed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
to identify the relative complexity of the terrain on these trails.
